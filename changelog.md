in begin(): it makes more sense to set the I2C speed first, then start a transmission.
in MCP7940.h: cleaned up formatting of the readRAM() and writeRAM() templates, and added some extra explanation here.
Updated, tested/corrected setAlarm().
Updated, tested setAlarmPolarity().
Updated, tested weekdayRead() & weekdayWrite(const uint8_t dow).
Fixed bug in dayOfTheWeek() - it was a day off due to incorrect calculation.
Updated getMFP() to allow for the other options. Returns value 0-3:
    0 = pin set LOW.
    1 = pin set HIGH.
    2 = pin controlled by alarms.
    3 = pin controlled by square wave output.
Updated, tested setMFP().
Updated, tested setSQWSpeed(). Added support for 64 Hz square wave output.
Updated, tested getPowerFail() & clearPowerFail().
